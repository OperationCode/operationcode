    <h3>Code Schools</h3>
    <p>
      Code Schools, coding bootcamps, vocational schools for aspiring programmers are the
      modern day Ford training plants uniquely designed to teach you to start writing software
      on day-one for today's jobs. They are hands-on accelerated learning programs that are both
      practical and immediately applicable for software developer entry jobs. Each code school listed
      below range between 3 to 9 months in length, vary in tuition costs (free to $17k), and in
      programming language.  Often dsirable from the employer standpoint, they are founded by software
      developers who saw a need in the marketplace for more programmers.

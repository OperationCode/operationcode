          <h2>Benefits Creep, Part I</h2>
          <p>By Mark Kerr
        </a>
        <p>
        Much of the country was shocked this month to hear about the mismanagement of a large veterans' non-profit organization. Sadly, this was not shocking news to the veteran community, which had a long growing suspicion that this organization was spending too much money on lavish benefits for its leaders and staff. Like many organizations, it had lost its way. <a href="https://operationcode.org/blog/2016/05/14/benefits-creep-part-1.html">[Read more]</a>

        At Operation Code, we go beyond just saying “support our veterans, troops, and their families,” we execute on it by providing the operating environment to become software developers. One company that is always shipping and enables Operation Code to fulfill our mission of getting more military veterans and their families coding is GitHub. <a href="https://operationcode.org/blog/2016/05/10/codeconf-la.html">[Read more]</a>

          <p>By David Molina
        </a>
        <p>
          At 1236 PST today, we received a much anticipated and welcomed phone call from the IRS regarding our submitted 501(c)(3) application. After some straggling to determine where the fax could be sent in, I took down the information from the agent and called our banker, Mr. Stanley Carpenter at Beneficial State Bank with the request for fax support. At 1419, the official 501(c)(3) was in our inbox. <a href="https://operationcode.org/blog/2016/05/04/501c3-confirmed.html">[Read more]</a>

  <h1 id="overview" class="page-header">David Molina</h1>
David Molina is the Founder & Executive Director of Operation Code, an organization dedicated to Veterans software development, mentorship and employment. Originally launched as an open source project to gather signatures to petition Congress to expand the New GI Bill, Operation Code has expanded its mission to equip Veterans and their families with access to 21st century software development education and mentorship to build products and services that will help build a stronger United States and better world.

From 2000 to 2013, Molina proudly served in the U.S. Army starting his career as an enlisted soldier in a Civil Affairs unit and after commissioning as an Infantry Officer in 2004 rose through the ranks to serve in increasing roles and responsibilities, including company executive officer, military aide-de-camp to general officer, summary court martial officer, plans & training officer, operations officer, public affairs and protocol officer. His last military assignment was in support of the unique war-time mission at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware at the Joint Personal Effects Depot (JPED) serving the Families of the Fallen mission.

Molina is a self-taught programmer having written his first line of code in HTML in 1996 in high school. Throughout the years he’s built numerous websites for his projects, businesses and military in various frameworks, including WordPress. Self-taught, he launched both the JPED’s intranet EIM SharePoint site and external public site in DotNetNuke, but when he applied for code school while on active-duty and couldn’t use his New GI Bill he turned his attention to self-learning and using online coding resources.

An alumni of Techstars Patriot Boot Camp, Molina transitioned to software development attending RailsConf (2013), and CascadiaRuby (2014) as a scholarship fellow, and Ruby on Ales (2014). Molina launched the first sites version at CascadiaRuby. Previously, he built bilingualhire.co, a bilingual jobs classified rails Ruby on Rails app, and over a dozen responsive and mobile-first websites and applications for a range of small businesses as a freelancer. His personal site is built on Middleman can be found at: http://davidmolina.github.io.

Captain Molina was released from active duty in February 2013 and honorably discharged in 2014 with a Meritorious Service Medal, Army Commendation Medal and Lt. Rowan Award. A 2014 graduate of Oregon State University in Political Science, he currently resides in Portland, Oregon with his wife and three young children.

          <div class="col-md-8"><h4 class="list-group-item-heading">Just imagine.</h4>
          <p>Just imagine for a moment if our grandparents had come back after WWII only to find out they couldn't use their GI Bill education benefits to seamlessly train for the Ford assembly plants of their day. Just imagine the shock. Today, these training plants are the modern day code schools that are training the next generation of new skills economy and knowledge workers needed today.</p>
          <p>In 2012, I applied to code school while still an Army Captain on active-duty and was shocked to know I couldn't use my New GI Bill education benefits. I tried again in 2014 to no avail. While I've self-learned, attended an <a href="http://angelhack.com/">AngelHack hackathon</a>, meetups at <a href="http://bmoreonrails.org/">B'more on Rails</a> and <a href="http://pdxruby.org/">Portland Ruby Brigade</a>, enrolled in <a href="http://www.thinkful.com/">Thinkful</a> front-end, and use <a href="https://hackhands.com/">HackHands</a> regularly, transitioning from military service to careers as software developers in the 21st century shouldn't be this challenging.</p>

          <p>As an unemployed/underemployed veteran, I decided to do something about it last summer after learning enough Ruby on Rails and getting massive encouragement from fellow rubyists and launched Operation Code to help get more military veterans coding. Many immediately stepped in to tell our story. Charles Sipe penned, "<a href="https://www.switchup.org/blog/why-veterans-will-make-excellent-programmers">Why Veterans Will Make Excellent Programmers</a>," and Susy Raybon wrote, "<a href="http://www.examiner.com/article/operation-code-provides-career-opportunities-for-military-veterans">Operation Code provides career opportunities for military veterans</a>." More recently, Teresa Mahoney, <a href="/media">interviewed</a> over a dozen veterans aspiring to be software developers and several code school directors.</p>

          <p>Army veteran and software developer, Dr. James Davis became our first mentor for our Software Mentor Protégé Program. More recently, Army veteran and iOS/Android developer, Fernando Paredes expanded on our software mentorship program into Slack helping veterans get coding in Android, C Sharp, Ember, Go, HTML, iOS, Java, JavaScript, Jekyll, Middleman, PHP, Python, and Ruby in our Peer-to-Peer community.</p>

          <p>This is an important fight. Doing our part to get more military veterans coding for gainful employment as software developers and putting a serious dent in our nation's technical talent shortage with American patriots is a moral & economic imperative.</p>

          <p>We hope you'll join us as we tackle military-civilian transition and veterans unemployment/underemployment by supporting military, veterans and military families to learn to code. Together, we are Operation Code.</p>

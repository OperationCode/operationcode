<!--   <h3 id="overview-doctype">What are code schools?</h3>
<p class="lead">Code schools are razer sharp specific programs that range from 3 mos to 7 mos with the focus of turning their students into entry-level developers. Code schools are founded by developers themselves.</p>
<h3 id="overview-mobile">What type of technology companies are we talking about?</h3>
<p class="lead">Technology companies that hire code school graduates vary, from small startups to venture-backed companies. Some graduates go onto work at small agencies, and some go onto launch their own tech companies.</p>
<h1 id="overview" class="page-header">Mission</h1>

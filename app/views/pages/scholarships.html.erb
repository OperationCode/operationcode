          One of the best ways to learn, network, and find job opportunities in the IT industry is through attending conferences.  My very first tech conference was Cascadia Ruby 2011 where I was amazed at the variety of talks (many covering technologies and techniques I was immediately able to apply in my work), the interesting conversations in the "hallway track", and the joy of talking with others working with the same technologies I was learning...<a href="https://operationcode.org/blog/2016/03/02/conference-scholarships.html">[Read more]</a>

    <p>Thanks for signing up and joining our ranks! I'm honored and humbled by your participation.</p>

    <p>As you may know I applied to code school while still a U.S. Army Captain on active-duty and was shocked to know I couldn't use my New GI Bill. This was in 2012. Again, I tried in 2014 and same answer. While I've self-learned, attended an <a href="http://angelhack.com/">AngelHack hackathon</a>, meetups at <a href="http://bmoreonrails.org/">B'more on Rails</a> and <a href="http://pdxruby.org/">Portland Ruby Brigade</a>, enrolled in <a href="http://www.thinkful.com/">Thinkful</a> front-end, and use <a href="https://hackhands.com/">HackHands</a> regularly, transitioning from military service to careers as software developers in the 21st century shouldn't be this challenging. Just imagine for a moment if our grandparents had come after WWII only to find out they couldn't use their GI Bill benefits to seamlessly train for the Ford assembly plants of their day? Those assembly plants today is today's software--and, none of us can use our GI Bill benefits to go to code school.</p>

    <p>As an unemployed/underemployed veteran, I decided to do something about it last summer after learning enough Ruby on Rails to gather signatures of military veterans to petition Congress to expand the New GI Bill to include, code school tuition, room and board. Many immediately stepped in to tell our story. Charles Sipe penned, "<a href="https://www.switchup.org/blog/why-veterans-will-make-excellent-programmers">Why Veterans Will Make Excellent Programmers</a>," and Susy Raybon wrote, "<a href="http://www.examiner.com/article/operation-code-provides-career-opportunities-for-military-veterans">Operation Code provides career opportunities for military veterans
    interest</a>," which has helped us grow our ranks.</p>

    <p><a href="https://github.com/cavalryjim">James Davis</a> became our first contributor and more recently, <a href="http://twitter.com/nanoxd">Fernando Paredes</a> expanded our Software Mentor Protégé Program into Slack. You will see him there as @nano. Programming languages include, HTML/CSS, Java, JavaScript, Golang, Ember, iOS, Android, and Ruby.</p>

    <p>In January this year we evolved as a non-profit w/ our fiscal sponsor, The Cogostar Foundation, and in April we launched our <a href="https://www.cogostar.org/projects/operationcode">crowdfunding campaign</a> to raise $7.5 million dollars to award coding scholarships. Through this process our videographer, Teresa Mahoney, <a href="http://operationcode.org/media">interviewed</a> over a dozen veterans and code school directors to share their compelling story.</p>

    <p>This is an important fight. Doing our part to get more military veterans coding for gainful employment as software developers and putting a serious dent in our nation's technical talent shortage with American patriots is an honor. <a href="http://operationcode.org/action">Join us</a> as we work to close this gap.</p>

    <p>Hooah and keep coding,</p>

      <p>As an unemployed/underemployed veteran, I decided to do something about it last summer after learning enough Ruby on Rails and getting massive encouragement from fellow rubyists and launched Operation Code to help get more military veterans coding. Many immediately stepped in to tell our story.

      <p>Army veteran and software developer, Dr. James Davis became our first mentor for our Software Mentor Protégé Program. More recently, Army veteran and iOS/Android developer, Fernando Paredes expanded on our software mentorship program into Slack helping veterans get coding in Android, C Sharp, Ember, Go, HTML, iOS, Java, JavaScript, Jekyll, Middleman, PHP, Python, and Ruby in our Peer-to-Peer community.</p>

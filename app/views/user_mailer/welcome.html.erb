<p>Check your inbox for an invite to our Slack (<a href="https://operation-code.slack.com">https://operation-code.slack.com</a>)</p>
<p>Once in Slack, navigate yourself to the #general tab and introduce yourself there, ex. name, branch of service and MOS, region you live now and the programming language you are interested in. If you are already in an online or campus code school mention that too.</p>
<p>Go ahead and subscribe to as many programming language channels as you wish, ex. #html, #ruby, #ios, and feel free to ask your questions there.</p>
<p>Spread the word to other veterans who could benefit from our growing Operation Code community.</p>

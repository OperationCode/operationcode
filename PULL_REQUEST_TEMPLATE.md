#Checklist for submitting a pull request

* Each pull request should:
	* Be tied to a single issue
	* Be named after the issue with the designated issue # as the name of the branch
	* Have its own tests
	* Not break existing tests

* Once your pull request has been submitted, it will be reviewed by a core team member. This process helps to familiarize more people with the codebase, and provides a second set of eyes and perspective to your new feature.

* If your code is accepted, it will be merged into the `master` branch. If all the tests pass, it will be automatically deployed to [operationcode.org](operationcode.org) immediately.

* Congratulations! You have made your first contribution!

Today, we’re happy to announce our partnership with Frisco, Texas-based, the [Guild of Software Architects](https://guildsa.org/veterans/), a mobile app development code school that offers courses for both the iOS and Android platforms.

What is remarkable is the founder’s story.

U.S. Navy veteran Kevin Harris couldn’t find meaningful work after his service in Desert Storm. He passed on college and taught himself to code, and prior to the Guild rose through the ranks to be lead wearables architect at Fossil.

According to Kevin:

> "We are excited to partner with Operation Code and introduce more veterans and their families to Mobile App Development."

[According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics](http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes151132.htm#st), DFW is one of the top metropolitan areas for developer jobs. We hope that the growing demand for these jobs, paired with a low percentage of women and veterans seeking them out, will encourage more members of this community to take advantage of the scholarships that we offer.

We couldn’t agree more with Kevin. Barrier to entry for high in-demand technical training is still too high with the majority of code schools inaccessible without the New GI Bill. The current greatest generation shouldn’t be left out in the dark and we couldn’t be more thrilled about this new scholarship and Dallas-Fort Worth community.

At the Guild, the course options range from an open-ended Guild Apprenticeship where students learn at their own pace, to Guild’s fully immersive 12-week Code Bootcamps which are highly focused on learning the required skills to work immediately upon graduation. While their ultimate end goal for both options is aimed at job placement, it’s about building a strong Dallas-Forth Worth community and enabling military veterans to learn the technical skills quickly and build software to change the world.

The Guild of Software Architects scholarship will offer **$3,000 off of $6,000 tuition for U.S. military veterans and their spouses** who are interested in breaking into a new career as a junior mobile developer.

At [Operation Code](https://operationcode.org/), we’re excited to see what our nation’s finest build after going through the Guild.

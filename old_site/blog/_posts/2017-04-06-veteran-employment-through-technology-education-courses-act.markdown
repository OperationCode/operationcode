Here at Operation Code, we strongly believe in our mission to get veterans coding. That is why we are very excited to support U.S. House of Representatives Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy’s bill that would give the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) $75 million dollars over five-years to support veterans in computer-related accelerated courses.
Today, the "Veteran Employment Through Technology Education Courses Act" or "VET TEC Act" was introduced into the House of Representatives and if passed would provide access to accelerated programs in computer-related fields, from programming to robotics, and from virtual reality to artificial intelligence, many of which are not are not currently covered by the New GI Bill.

Under Majority Leader McCarthy’s proposal, instead of going to a traditional college, or in addition to a traditional degree, veterans could get a shorter-term nano degree or micro credential and would be paid for by this new program and not with the veterans GI Bill. The VA would contract with companies to provide the training and pay them in installments: 25% when a veteran starts a course, 25% when the veteran finishes, and the rest when the veteran then lands a job. In addition, participating veterans would receive a housing allowance while in training.

We at Operation Code believe this is exactly the right way forward. It is unacceptable that according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics some 450,000 veterans in the United States are unemployed and 40% of them are between 18 and 44 years old. With the work ethic, attention to detail, and intelligence that serving in the military demands, veterans are perfect candidates to take advantage of the half a million jobs the tech industry will add in the next seven years.

Operation Code believes that all service members, veterans and their families should have access to career paths in software development and we will continue to work with our elected representatives to ensure that our voices are heard.

We've created a landing page to share more about the bill, how you can help, and companies that support the bill. Common sense legislation that streamlines educational access to our nation’s finest should be something we can all get behind.

Together we are Operation Code.

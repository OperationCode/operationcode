Veterans have been suffering from high unemployment rates for years, but the strategies designed to employee these veterans haven’t changed. The [most current numbers](http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/11/10/private-sector-tackles-veteran-unemployment)** **were released to media sources in late 2014. Force reduction has hit all branches of the military. The [Army alone has plans to reduce its numbers by 200,000 Soldiers,](http://www.armytimes.com/story/military/careers/army/2014/12/26/2015-drawdown-year-ahead/20860491/) which, no doubt, will lead to increased unemployment for veterans.

There are hundreds of thousands of tech jobs in the United States that are currently going unfilled; at the same time, hundreds of thousands of veterans are looking for new careers. The good news for veterans is landing one of these high paying jobs doesn’t require a computer science degree.

“Coding Boot Camps” or “Code Schools” have opened up across the country. Their strategy is to immerse students with little to no computer coding experience with intense coding skills in 9 to 12 week courses. By the end of the course the students have the skills to enter the tech scene as junior web developers or computer programmers. The best part is that, at the end of the course, the students are getting hired, with good salaries. Tech companies are poised to hire more of these highly trained students. Veterans are the perfect match.

“Coding boot camps” cost a fraction of a four year degree for which veterans can use their G.I. Bill benefits. However, the cost is around $12,000, placing them financially out of reach for most veterans. The G.I. Bill has not kept up with the explosive success of code schools and currently does not cover the expense of attending one.

Operation Code is a grassroots, 501(C)(3) non-profit organization started by Army Veteran, Captain David Molina. Operation Code is on a mission to help transition veterans and separating military members to a software career through a network of already established partnerships. Veterans who sign up on OperationCode.org are automatically eligible to receive a code school scholarship and mentorship sessions with experienced software developers.

Both [US News](http://money.usnews.com/careers/best-jobs/software-developer) and CNN Money have recently placed software developers and web developers among the top 25 careers in America. Software developers invent the technologies that most take for granted every day; like phone apps and ring tones.

Veterans agree it is time for the G.I. Bill to keep pace. For more information, visit OperationCode.org, or follow on Twitter at:[https://twitter.com/operation_code](https://twitter.com/opcod3us).

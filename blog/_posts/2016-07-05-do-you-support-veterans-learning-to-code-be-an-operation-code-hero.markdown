Now that you’ve taken off your active duty uniform, don’t you wish you had something new to wear for your midnight coffee runs and 24 hour hackathons that’s not only comfortable and stylish but also supports the* only open source and hackable veterans organization dedicated to teaching vets and families to build awesome things with code?*

[Operation Code](https://operationcode.org/) is dedicated to ensuring that our nation’s finest don’t get left behind and offers programs to veterans and families at no-cost to that help those who’ve served learn to build software that changes the world.

Until July 31st, you can support the Operation Code Scholarship Fund by purchasing an [Operation Code Tee](https://www.booster.com/operationcode)! You’ll gain karma by spreading the word with a fancy new t-shirt while helping veterans from around the U.S. [jumpstart their careers by attending software conferences](https://medium.com/@JonDeng/applying-open-source-lessons-to-getting-veterans-to-code-dcbe4f7cd065#.dl1yhmj4i) to network with other developers and possibly find a job.

These premium American Apparel jersey shirts are only available until July 31st, and the proceeds go to the Operation Code Scholarship fund, [so get one now](https://www.booster.com/operationcode) while your app is compiling.

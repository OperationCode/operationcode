Some heartbreaking news came in the form of sort of an impromptu talk that I had with the lead developer at my job. I’ve recently completed a three month contract (as a matter of fact, I’d only had only have two weeks left in the contract at the time of the conversation), and I wanted to get a status on how I was doing, and what I can expected in the next two weeks. Would I be hunkering down in my desk permanently? Will I be get back to the many recruiters that have been reaching out to me since I started the job back in August? I want to start this off by saying this, nothing that was said was unexpected, it didn’t stop it from sucking, but I digress.

#### You Are Going To Make An Awesome Developer………

Those were the words that were said to me, as what felt like, for the hundredth time since starting my career in development, I was being told that it was not the right time for me to be somewhere. I’m not sure if any of you who are reading this know this, but up until recently, I’ve had some rotten luck when it comes to finding, and keeping a development job. And while some of my Dev Bootcamp compatriots have been able to find jobs that they love (one of which, just moved to Chicago to help open a second office in Chicago, for a company that he hasn’t worked for very long) I haven’t even made it past three months at a place. The plan was to bring on a junior that they could grow, and work with personally, however plans changed and the senior developer is moving into another role, and needs a developer with more experience to move into the role that will be left empty once the shift is complete.

#### It’s getting frustrating……..

And by that I mean nothing short of infuriating. It feels like my well being at this point has been nothing but a series of experiments for other folks,

> “Should we have a junior dev/apprentice? Let’s find out if we’re suited to handle it.”

I’m sure none of these places have meant any ill will towards me, that is to say that was not their intention to pull someone on, and then have to let them go. Things change, and with that any intentions that anyone has, tend to go out of the window. The job I had before this one, was an apprenticeship with a relatively small company that was trying to implement an apprenticeship program, things changed and it didn’t work out. This current job is with a small shop that does dev and design, and has a three person dev team, that has a senior dev, a mid level dev, and a junior dev (me), and will go back down to two, once the contract that I signed is up.

#### This Only Seems To Happen When I Get Comfortable……

The past year has been a series of ups and downs, when I found this job, we weren’t in the best spot, we were barely making ends meet with just my husband working. This wasn’t just a job for me, this was a way for us to get out of this neighborhood, and a way for my husband to make the transition he needs to get out of the job that he has that he hates. I didn’t want to settle in becuase this was a contract, but it happened, I got used to having a job that I enjoyed, in an enviroment that I enjoyed being in, with people that I enjoy working and collaborating with on a daily basis. I wasn’t even sure about whether or not I should ask about it becuase I knew it would be disappointed if I were told that this wasn’t working out.

It would be different, if it wasn’t the second time that this has happened since I’ve started work as a developer.

#### How I’m Handling it………

I’m not really sure how to handle it, and I don’t know what to do at this point. I feel very discouraged as my foray into development has not be an easy one, while others that I know have found jobs that they enjoy thoroughly, I haven’t been able to have a job for more than three months until I’m told “it’s not you, it’s us we had some things change”.

To be honest, I love where I work, I like the people, I like environment, and I like the fact that I can wear blue jeans, and my superhero t-shirts to work every day (not having to worry about fitting into a box is awesome).

It’s becoming bothersome to apply for a job, and get it, and then to be told that it wasn’t what they were expecting it to be, and that I have to be let go as a result. Even morso,I get to hear that it’s not my fault, that doesn’t help me feel better about not being able to keep the job, it makes me feel inadequate, and it makes me wonder if I made the correct career choice when all it has been for me, is one experiment after another for companies who aren’t sure whether or not they can handle it.

My advice to anywhere that is looking to hire a junior as a junior is this: Get the opinions of the dev team first and find out if they feel comfortable having someone they have to slow things down for at times, make sure you understand that a junior developer slows things down, either a little or a lot something that can take someone ten minutes to knock out, may not come so easily to someone who is considered a junior, and you might need to break things down for them to understand

The former Army personnel manager had long contemplated a career change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meet Andrea, a self-described random job expert. After her service as a U.S. Army Human Resource Specialist she held many jobs and admits, “I never really found that one thing that really drove me.” One day a serendipitous online search resulted in more than she expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I googled veterans + coding” says Andrea. It listed two results, one of them was Operation Code. As she scrolled the Operation Code webpage she learned that the non-profit organization’s mission is to aid military vets and their families learn code and web technology. She decided to reach out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially, because she had no previous program experience, she lacked confidence. 
Andrea acknowledged to herself and to others that a new skill would be difficult to learn. Given that her GI Bill benefits had come and gone (without her tapping into them) she specifically sought career advancement resources which wouldn’t cost a lot of money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then Operation Code offered to set her up with a mentor, which they did. According to Conrad Hollomon, Operation Code’s Chief of Staff, mentorship is “absolutely critical” in helping someone reach their greatest potential in the tech industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Andrea was now engaging in online communities focused on everything from open source to coding. With a combination of her do-it-yourself learning and mentor support her confidence increased. Furthermore, she believed her military background and entrepreneurial spirit made her special. But was she ready to apply for a job in tech?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then one day Andrea opened her inbox. She received a job announcement which had been forwarded to her by David Molina, Operation Code’s Founder &amp;amp; CEO. The employer was Github. Yes, Github; the multi-million dollar software company operating out of Silicon Valley. She was initially apprehensive about applying, mainly for family reasons. But after careful consideration and conversations with her supportive partner, she applied. After a four month process she received the job offer last November. “January 10th was my first day on the job” shares Andrea who credits Operation Code and the resources they shared with making the difference.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Edward Gutierrez</name></author><category term="Article" /><summary type="html">A search engine introduced Andrea to Operation Code.

I guess I don’t look much like G.I. Joe, so I can appreciate their surprise when this is uncovered. Nevertheless, it’s true; I joined the military six years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naturally, I learned a lot— more things than I had anticipated. But what’s been most surprising is how the half-life for these lessons has extended beyond the barracks and STX (situational training exercises). I probably shouldn’t be surprised, but they’ve been useful in my day-to-day work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought I’d share one of those experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I now work as a Product Manager for a growing software company. The two worlds don’t seem obviously-related. They aren’t at first glance. I don’t wear a uniform, and I don’t have to shave every morning (thank. god.). There are no guns or Humvee’s. Despite this, it’s been sort-of-astonishing how many times I’ve connected something back to an experience I had in the Army.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, our team has struggled with the idea of how much “process” we want. There was a vague understanding that more was needed, but exactly “how much” was left to debate. Some? A smidgen? A lot? There was no clear-cut answer. There rarely is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For context, we’ve been growing quickly since we launched our product in 2009. We added seventy-five new teammates just this past year. As the team grows, things understandably get more complicated. Communication becomes more difficult. Decisions can take longer. There are more viewpoints to account for. Like anything, there are trade-offs. There is also more collective experience. More diversity in thought. More hands to help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our application is also segmented into three smaller products, and the needs, constraints, maturation, and user expectations for the three aren’t always the same. This poses a challenge to deciding how we want to update and maintain the application. We are one team, with one code base, three primary products, and many different visions for how much process we need on the dev side of the house. Do we need managers? Should we all be forced to use the same release process? Do we need to build specialized development tools? We even joke that one engineer was named “Rules” while the other should be called “Guidelines.” We are at an impasse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somehow this triggered a memory from the Army in my strange brain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flash back to 2010. There I am. Twenty-two, clean shaven, wide-eyed. The very picture of youth. (haha) I’m at Fort Knox, Kentucky. It’s July — that means the ambient temperature is “face-of-the-sun” and the humidity is at “monsoon rain storm.” I’m miserable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are dozens of young soldiers just like me spread out, lying prone on the gravel that borders the edge of a jungle that looms just in front of us. Our dirty, “digital” uniforms and patrol caps blend in with the grey color of the gravel, and we look like a peculiar pattern of many-colored faces dotting the ground. It’s dusk, and soon each face is accompanied by a sudden eerie red glow — the filtered light coming from each of our flashlights. There’s something alien about it all. We’re all silently scribbling and making notations on small maps laid out in front of us. No one speaks. Shortly after, one of us abruptly gets up and heads steadfast into the dark forest. It swallows him whole. The only thing you can see is that red orb bouncing up-and-down and then disappearing into the black. Soon after, another soldier sprints into the forest. She’s gone. Then another. One-by-one we‘re all eventually consumed by the jungle. We’re all after something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were practicing something called “night land nav.” — one of the many fun things you’re introduced to in the military. It’s the Army’s twist on hide-and-go-seek. You’re taught how to get around using a map, protractor, and a Tritium-illuminated Lensatic Marching Compass. It makes sense, really. Soldiers should be able to get to important way-points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The objective is to locate several small metal stakes hidden throughout the terrain. The stakes are each separated by several kilometers, obscured by vegetation, and are only a meter tall. Each is equipped with an alpha-numeric label and a “clacker” that you use to stamp a card you’ve been given to verify you’ve found an assigned way-point. You can only use red-colored light, or else you’d compromise your night vision. It’s an individual endeavor. You aren’t allowed to collaborate; you can’t consult your battle buddy. There’s a time limit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Truth be told, this was one of my favorite exercises. I love being outdoors. I enjoy having a clear purpose, and I liked the time to myself (something that’s a rarity in the Army). I also had a natural affinity for it; I am a stake-locating machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, the Army doesn’t point young soldiers toward the jungle and tell them, “Good luck.” Prior to stepping off we’re all prepared with some simple tactics we can employ to accomplish our task. (Gasp! A small process of sorts.) Simple tactics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s fairly basic in theory, and somewhat more complicated in practice. You have a map that’s divided into equal-sized squares. The squares are organized into a grid, and the grids all have corresponding coordinates. This is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_grid_reference_system&quot;&gt;Military Grid Reference System&lt;/a&gt; (MGRS). You’re provided a sheet of paper with several eight-digit grid locations for your stakes. The eight-digit location is accurate to within ten meters (around thirty feet). You start by sitting down and using your protractor and pencil to plot your points on the map and get a lay of the land. You usually take note of identifiable terrain features — like spurs, draws, hilltops, cliffs, saddles. You can triangulate your position on the map by using these landmarks later on. You’re taught how to measure distance by walking a hundred meters and counting the number of times your left foot strikes the ground. (My pace count is sixty-three left steps to every hundred meters.) The lensatic compass allows you to determine direction. You formulate a basic plan, and then head off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There I was. It was hot outside. My uniform’s coarse cloth was now heavy and sticking against my skin, which irritated the many insect bites peppered along my arms and legs. I only had a few hours to find the stakes spread out across the Ft. Knox jungle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like the others, I was lying prone on the gravel, which made it difficult to lay the map flat. It was hard to make out the green-colored terrain markings in the red light. The pencil couldn’t be bothered to work in the rain. But I got it done. I made a basic plan. I had a way forward, and I headed off into the darkness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My plan went to shit pretty quickly. The route I had planned was flooded at a certain point, and I had to take a long detour. The clearing I had wanted to traverse as a shortcut was now overgrown. My current circumstances forced me to reevaluate. Improvise. Adapt. I persevered onward. I trusted myself to overcome the obstacles. I still had the same simple strategies I could use over and over again to reshape my plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes my new plan would work as if by magic or divine intervention. Everything went smoothly. I’d shoot an azimuth, count my steps, and would be rewarded with a satisfying CLACK at the stake. Success. I was learning. I realized I could anticipate where flooding might be by looking closer at the contour lines that indicated elevation on the map. Even still, the plan would inevitably turn to shit again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No kidding, my flashlight broke. I could hear the pieces rattling inside the housing. Its music seemed to celebrate and mock my impending doom. Luckily, the Army preaches “one is none; two is one.” I had a back up, but this light was much smaller and less powerful. It was almost impossible to see. My fortune had turned; the land-nav gods had looked down on me again. Nonetheless, I steadily reached my way-points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few hours later, you could hear me crashing through the forest like a drunken bear. I was sprinting wildly toward my last point. I was in a foot race against time. The amazing thing was I didn’t have any discomfort. I wasn’t over-heated anymore. I didn’t notice the insect bites. The rain didn’t bother me. I later discovered I had formed a blister on the bottom of my left foot that spanned its entire length. It had swelled up and deflated like a forgotten birthday balloon. I hadn’t noticed. I hadn’t noticed because I was absolutely focused on the task at hand. I was like Gollum in pursuit of the One Ring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I arrived to a small opening in the woods. Panting. Crazed. Wild-eyed. My calculations had indicated my last stake would be nearby. But where was it? Had my faulty plan betrayed me again? Had my compass broken, and led me astray? I could have panicked. I nearly did. Instead, I returned to my simple strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember, the eight-digit grid is only accurate to within ten meters. I had been taught how to handle this. I just needed to make slowly-widening concentric circles around where I thought the point should be. Eventually, I’d have to run into the stake as I completed my orbits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made one loop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Faithfully, I made two more loops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not a thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started to doubt. I had to continue on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the start of my next cycle my boot struck something. It struck victory. (haha) My nemesis now stood at my feet. Its little steel body was twisted downward toward the wet ground and was partially covered with undergrowth — making it difficult to see. But its trickery had been no match for this cool-headed warrior. I bent down and moved the brush aside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“A15”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d remember the name. May it R.I.P. (This foe.) I grabbed the clacker, punched my card, and began the long trek back to the staging area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A while later I returned to where it had all started. The eerie red glow had been replaced with an inky purple in the absence of the many flashlights. I turned my card in, changed out of my wet uniform, and unpacked my sleep system. Exhausted, I crawled into the camouflaged bivy sack and quickly drifted off to sleep. The clouds had cleared by now. (Of course, that was my luck.) I remember the upright trees had cut the silhouette of an elephant into the night sky — its trunk spotted with a famous constellation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cool story, bro. But what’s this got to do with the maintenance of software?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, okay. I admit: I’ve been a bit tangential. I’ll loop it back now. How does this story relate to that dilemma at work — the impasse? For a while, I wasn’t sure where I stood on the whole thing. On one hand, It would be nice to have some clear-cut rules. On the other hand, I was afraid we’d end up creating miles of red tape. I mulled it over. It wasn’t an easy problem; there were merits on both sides. I realized my brain had done me a solid by dredging up this old memory. There was something to be learned here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It became more clear the more I contemplated it. My thoughts began to take shape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s what I came up with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Simple strategies trump rigid processes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There wasn’t one magical solution that helped me find my way. I didn’t set out thinking, “I will walk 50 meters, pull out my compass, shoot a 178-degree bearing, put the compass in my left pocket, take a sip of water, continue 43 meters…” I knew I’d be prepared no matter what happened because I had a set of straightforward principles I could rely on. Any complicated process would have been too costly to use out there when it mattered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Most soldiers found their way, but took different paths.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were dozens and dozens of soldiers wandering the forest that night. None of us had the same combination of way-points, but the objective was the same: find all the points. How we got there was irrelevant. None of us had the same route. Each solider took the path that made the most sense given their starting point and their unique set of constraints and conditions. I’m sure some learned the hard way, but we were better for it in the long run. We could share the lessons we learned. The best solution is tailored to the surrounding circumstance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Start with a basic plan, and anticipate it will change.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My plan fell apart umpteen times. I anticipated it would, and that made it easier to adapt. A plan is a starting point. I would have failed and run out of time if I had spent too much effort devising the “perfect plan.” It was important to just start moving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;You don’t need fancy tools.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would it have been easier if I had a GPS and four-wheeler? Definitely. Was the compass, flashlight, map, and “know how” enough to get the job done? It was. I was able to hone my skills because I was forced to rely on simple strategies and basic tools. I became a better navigator because of it. Better tools would have made me more efficient, but they also would represent new complexities and points of failure — points of failure I likely wouldn’t have been able to overcome without a deeper understanding of terrain, map-reading, pace counts, etc. Tools can supplement understanding, but are not a replacement for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Focus can override discomfort.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My discomfort diminished as the night wore on. I barely noticed the heat, weather, or exhaustion. I became so focused on my task that I couldn’t be bothered to be distracted by anything else. Similarly, teams can withstand a lot if they’re focused on a clear goal — everything else (the disagreements, lack of resources, etc.) take a backseat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do I think we need managers (in the traditional sense)? Nah. Do I think we need a process, or set of processes, that can be applied universally? Probably not; I believe there’s a balance, and that each small team can decide what works best for them and their unique context. What about development tools? I think we can get by with something lightweight, and build from there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is just my position. Our team is still wrestling with this. We haven’t arrived to a decision. Overall, I’m thankful I work with people who care enough to have a stance, and I’m confident everything will work out. If someone like me can find a one-meter-tall stake in the ground. In a jungle. At night. In the rain. With just a compass, map, and a few basic strategies. Then I’m sure we can figure things out.&lt;/p&gt;

Since starting, I’ve talked to a lot of developers, read a lot of blogs, and let my mind wander during my morning runs. Despite attending a boot camp (which has been an invaluable learning experience!), I still want to maintain the ethic of a self-taught programmer, who makes it a personal responsibility to teach him/herself the skills to become successful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My main intention remains unchanged. I want to become a software engineer who:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;is comfortable learning new technologies and developing in them despite not being an expert yet&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;relishes the hunt of debugging and figuring why software is not acting according to expectations&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;plays well with others — empathetic, fun to work with, and pushes the team forward in moments of indecision&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;clearly communicates complex topics so that people who are exposed to the concept for the first time can understand. Also, speak in a way that gets non-technical people stoked about technical projects!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, now that I’ve had more exposure to what’s possible in web development, I added a few experiences/ projects that I want to make a priority over the next few months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goals kept secret have a way of disappearing or getting rationalized away when things get busy, so in order to make sure I stay committed to them, &lt;strong&gt;I’m posting them publicly:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create a non-trivial React application with Redux as a state-container and Node as the back-end. This project needs to be well-documented, organized, and have a testing suite.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Explore alternative ways of User Interface that are not just browser-based webpages. Either build a mobile project with React Native, a server-side chatbot project, or combine both.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create a useful developer tool that abstracts away a pain point in the development process. Publish this this tool into an npm package that gets 1000 downloads.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Continue to produce blog posts that provide value for other developers coming from non-traditional paths, especially veterans, and help solidify my mastery of concepts by using the learning by teaching approach.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Maintain my mental, emotional and physical health to allow me to continue to be a good person in stressful situations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s it! There’s a few other things I’d like to do- continue to contribute to Operation Code, look for apartments in LA, run another ultra-marathon- but for the next few months, those are going to have to take a backseat to priorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re also becoming a self-taught developer, I’d love to see what your short term goals are- just drop a link in the comments section! I think planning in 3-month intervals allows you to stay flexible and keep yourself accountable over the short term.&lt;/p&gt;

I’m a US Army officer, currently on reserve status, one tour in Afghanistan from 2010-2011. In the military, I led IT and tactical communications teams, and worked hard to develop my fellow Soldiers and help them reach their full potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m currently working for a venture-backed energy tech startup called SparkMeter, developing a smart metering system that’s being widely adopted by utilities serving customers in rural parts of Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and Latin America and the Caribbean. It’s a great product that will help expand access to electricity for developing countries and emerging markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been fascinated by technology since I was a kid, and throughout the years, that’s never changed. I got started in the tech industry working in QA at a video game developer called Harmonix Music Systems, where I learned what it was like to develop innovative products, and how engineers and designers came together to deliver awesome experiences for people. Ever since, I’ve been dedicated to helping people build great products, working hard to be a positive driving force for any team, by bringing an creative, collaborative, and decisive mindset to the table. The experience has taught me that innovation originates from inspiring leadership, and that inspiring leadership originates from service to others. This takes integrity, authenticity, and just a little bit of audacity, too. Why CodeConfLA?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Github is a cornerstone of the open source community, and having the opportunity to be a direct part of that community via this scholarship is a great honor. The way we build and design software has such a tremendous impact on the end product that users see, and use, and love - finding ways to learn from each other, finding ways to build cool things better and faster, is a true joy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning to code is hard. This is further exacerbated by antiquated hardware and software. As a coding nonprofit serving the nation’s finest and their families, we’re always looking for new ways to partner and work with passionate businesses and organizations that care and help us meet our mission. Fortunately, there is TechSoup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TechSoup is a nonprofit with a clear focus: to make it as easy as possible for other nonprofits and libraries to obtain and use the technologies they need to achieve their missions. TechSoup provides access to over 400 technology products donated by more than 45 companies, including donor partners like Microsoft, Adobe, Cisco, Intuit, and Symantec.

&lt;p&gt;Our Software Mentor Protégé Program leverages real-time messaging application, &lt;a href=&quot;https://slack.com&quot;&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt;, to welcome transitioning military, guard &amp;amp; reserve soldiers, veterans and their families share code and get help hacking on their websites or web applications, quickly communicate between volunteers and the board, all in a decentralized, asynchronous platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier last year iOS/Android developer &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/nanoxd&quot;&gt;Fernando Paredes&lt;/a&gt; setup Slack and seamlessly integrated it into our Ruby on Rails application so that each time a new veteran joined, he/she would get an immediate invite and join us. But as you can imagine we quickly capped the 10k message limit prohibiting anyone to see past a few page scrolls. Last summer I sent over a request to Slack, but due to tax-exemption status couldn’t get it lifted. Fortunately, all that changed earlier this month with the IRS approving our tax-exemption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slack added fully searchable archive w/ unlimited messages, unlimited external integrations, simple usage statistics, custom message retention policies, guest access, and premium support to Operation Code’s Slack channel. As a result new channels are being created to better serve our military veterans community and their pursuit for becoming programmers. The latest channel: eloquent-javascript.&lt;br /&gt;
New military veterans who just joined Operation Code will now enjoy a more seamless experience and so will our &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/OperationCode/operationcode/graphs/contributors&quot;&gt;contributors&lt;/a&gt; in adding new Slack external functionalities. Special thanks to the incredible team at Slack for always being helpful and for an incredible and ever useful tool that allows all of us who’ve served or are serving from all corners of the globe to learn to code and help the transition to become programmers less painful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheers and keep coding,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of the country was shocked this month to hear about the mismanagement of a large veterans’ non-profit organization.  Sadly, this was not shocking news to the veteran community, which had a long growing suspicion that this organization was spending too much money on lavish benefits for its leaders and staff.   Like many organizations, it had lost its way – getting caught up in its own success and giving the appearance that its leaders were more interested in serving themselves and not veterans.  In contrast to mission-creep, where an organization gets farther and farther from its core mission, this is “Benefits-Creep” in which an organization over-expands the perks it offers to leadership and staff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For most of us who found or start working for non-profits, we do so with the best intentions at heart.  With success, however, it becomes easier to justify expenses that in the beginning we never would have considered.  There are a few reasons for benefits-creep:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More money.  With more money, “luxury” expenses become easier to afford.  Also, if looked at as a percentage of the budget, expenses may even go down as the quality of things like hotels, dinners, and flights increase.  Clearly, many non-profit leaders are falling into the trap of setting expenses by a percentage of budget rather than by need.  Under a percentage allocation, if a travel budget of $1,000 can be justified on a $10,000 budget, then when the budget is $100,000, these leaders think is perfectly OK to spend $10,000.  While that may be true for business owners who get to reap the rewards of their increased profits, it is not true for non-profits who must also be looking to serve the public and must guard against percentage-based benefits-creep.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The new normal.  Imagine a non-profit that is going through growing pains.  Maybe its management is having trouble dealing with expanded numbers of staff, or perhaps turnover has caused morale problems.  In order to fix these problems, which are having a real impact on the non-profit’s ability to provide services, leadership determines to have a “retreat” to refocus. Maybe they go to a leadership camp or fly-in the whole board for a team building weekend. While this is more expensive than their normal travel budgets, it may be entirely legitimate and help fix issues. The problem comes the following year:  there is no major issue but everyone remembers how nice last year’s event was.  Who wants to have a day long retreat in town, when last year’s weekend event by the lake was so much fun?  Once again, the travel budget goes up, and the following year it goes up again.  In this case, something that was meant to be an exception to policy became the new normal.  The new normal can cause benefits-creep almost anywhere in the budge from travel, dinners, snacks in the kitchen, to even who gets what type of office chair.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Outside influence and Expert Volunteers.  As a non-profit grows, more people are going to be interested in helping it. These may be business leaders that want to serve on the board or upper-income volunteers that want to help with events.  These volunteers are critical to an organization’s growth:  they help raise expectations, diversify funding streams, expose the organization to new management paradigms, and provide critical staff-power.  Operation Code is experiencing such an influx right now in its JAG Brigade, which has greatly increased its capability by adding lawyers who are volunteering from Hunton &amp;amp; Williams, one of the largest and best law firms in the country. Operation Code’s JAG Brigade is meant to do two things:  1. provide legal services to veterans in software development that have legal issues, such as incorporating their own business  or protecting intellectual property, and 2. assist coding schools with filing to be eligible to receive the G.I. Bill so veterans can use their benefits to learn to code.  Obviously, having top notch attorneys such as Penn Law graduate, Stefano D’Aniello, or Yale Law alum, Jordi Martinez-Cid, is critical to providing veterans the best legal support on these issues, but top law firms operate on radical different budgets than non-profits.  This budget gap may lead to different expectations.   The JAG Brigade is blessed – its volunteers from Hunton &amp;amp; Williams are down to earth attorneys and Hunton &amp;amp; Williams has a great deal of experience in helping small organizations and veterans.  Not every non-profit will be so lucky in getting expert volunteers with realistic expectations.  Leadership must help manage the expectations of successful leaders and experts brought in to help the organization.  Too often wealthy benefactors may suggest either budget busting endeavors or the expansion of small non-essential items that lead to inappropriate benefits-creep.  This is especially important to watch for as often these benefactors will offer to fund the extra benefits, and so it will seem to the non-profit that there is no harm.  However, perception can quickly become reality and explaining to other donors or the IRS how the retreat to a luxury resort was ear-marked by a donor that picked up the extra cost is not a good position to be in.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the source of benefits-creep, it can be dangerous to an organization’s bottom-line, its perception in the community, and worst of all to its legal standing.  Non-profit leaders must continually be managing both budgets and expectations to stop benefits-creep.  In Part II of this series, I walk through the strategies Operation Code has put in place to stop benefits-creep and ensure that when budgets go up our beneficiaries are the ones that benefit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are three reasons non-profits succumb to benefits-creep.  Please share your experiences with how you have seen benefits-creep impact non-profits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congrats! You just completed your boot camp! You spent the last 12/16 weeks of your life busting your behind and you came out victorious. You can make cool applications, you can configure a webserver, and you even understand how miserable/important it is to write unit tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the boot camp you just completed isn’t operated by Uncle Sam. There is no guaranteed position waiting for you after family day. You still need to convince someone other than your Mom that you and your skills are worth taking a chance on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, it is true. The tech field is growing. The need for developers appears to be growing each year. Learning to code is becoming very popular and it has never been easier/cheaper to get started. The vast amount of online resources available is mind-blowing. Boot camps are becoming more popular, and alternatives like FreeCodeCamp (sidenote - FCC has a pretty awesome curriculum and a great community) are keeping the dream alive. Oh and don’t forget about the constant stream of new Computer Science grads hitting the streets. What does this mean for people like you and me? It means that there are more people competing for those entry-level positions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is that you are Awesome. You were an amazing Soldier/Marine/Airman/Sailor and you will become an amazing developer. It just takes some time and a little elbow grease… You’ve dealt with deployments, long training exercises, endless 24 hour shifts, and soul-robbing safety briefings. You can land that first job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a look some tips that I found helpful during my recent search. The suggestions are in no particular order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disclosure - These suggestions may or may not apply to you and your situation/location. Please read them all but cherry-pick only what you feel is best for you and your bottom line. I am certainly no expert and currently in month two of my first developer gig. The market for developer gigs is highly dependent on location. A fresh boot camp grad located in Boise will likely have a different set of challenges than a grad located in the Bay Area. My experience took place in a mid-sized city on the West Coast with a relatively large number of boot camp grads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Portfolio page &amp;gt; GitHub page
Having an organized GitHub account with a solid commit history is absolutely essential. You must show employers that those cool acronyms you put on your resume are actually backed up by real work. However, looking at code on GitHub is boring. Often times your resume will be screened by HR and may get weeded out before it ever gets in the hands of a real human developer. A well designed portfolio site can help increase your chances. Your portfolio site should be clean and easy to navigate. Avoid free domains and get a real “.com” domain. “FirstnameLastname.com” or something similar looks way better than, “firstnamelastname.myfreewebhostingdomain.net”
Display all of your projects that you are proud of. Don’t just include a screen capture. Configure your applications so that the user can run them from your site. Include some brief comments for each application that highlight the technologies/ skills you used to create the application. “Card game built with JQuery, uses AJAX calls to pull user data from back-end, etc…” Include a link to the GitHub repo that houses the code for the particular application. Plaster your new URL on all of your resumes/job postings/LinkedIn. Check your site regularly to make sure everything is functioning properly!
You can register a domain name for a year for $10ish dollars and use a service like AWS for free hosting.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Network!
Trying to find a job sucks. Go hang out and commiserate with others in your same situation. Even small cities have all sorts of weekly/monthly tech meetups. These meetups serve multiple purposes, Meet up with others in your same situation. Trade notes on who is hiring, interview tips, and contact information for hiring managers. You may be a Ruby cat and your buddy may be a C# nerd. Look out for one another and send job postings his/her way when you see something that fits their talents. Learn! Meetups are great for getting out of “code bubbles.” In a boot camp setting, all of the students will tend to do things in a similar fashion based on what the instructor does or doesn’t do. Bust out of these routines and check out how others from different backgrounds tackle the same problems. Meet people that are actually doing what you want to do. Pretty self-explanatory… Ask them questions until you are blue in the face.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Craigslist?
When I first began my job search, I had numerous people tell me to avoid finding jobs on Craigslist. They told me that it was full of scams and flaky people. They were partially right. Craigslist does seem to attract all sorts of crap but it can also be a gold mine! Make sure you are still hitting up the big boards (indeed, glassdoor, dice, etc…) but also check out Craigslist daily. The scam postings are pretty easy to recognize and you can protect yourself by doing a little research on the company before you send in your information.
The Craigslist job section seems to attract smaller companies with less bureaucratic human resource departments. Therefore, if you get your application in ASAP (First 24-48 hours after it was posted) there is a very good chance that your resume will be viewed by a real live person instead of a resume-eating algorithm. (Sidenote- You should be responding to all job postings shortly after they are posted. I never had luck with postings that were more than a couple weeks old)
Craigslist postings also tend to require just a resume and cover letter. Anyone that has had to slay the Taleo dragon will understand how important this is.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Go big or go home!
You now have an awesome portfolio site, your resume is legit, and you tailor cover letters to the job posting. Start pumping out those applications. Get your numbers up! The more applications you put out there, the greater chance you have of getting a call back. Unless you already have a job you need to treat your job hunt like it’s a full-time position. Apply to all positions you feel qualified for. Be advised that many postings are written by non-technical people and are simply a wish list for the “perfect” candidate. Be honest on your resume and in your interactions with the company but don’t be afraid to apply for a position that requires “3-5 years experience” when you have 1-2 years experience.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Branch out
Maybe your boot camp focused on Ruby/JS/HTML. Perhaps it was Python/Django/JS. Or maybe PHP/JS/HTML? You are probably looking for the junior “web developer” position but don’t forget about the wide world of IT, QA, and mid level technical support positions! Check out indeed for QA and “technical support engineer” positions. Many of these positions will have you working with code on a daily basis and offer great opportunities for growth. Spending a year or two doing QA can be an awesome way to get your foot into the developer side of the house.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Intern
If you can afford to spend a couple more months without an income, look into internships. I have a met a number of people that rocked out during an internship and were offered a position with the company. Even if the company decides to not offer you a position, you will still be able to list this real world experience on your resume. If the company you are interested in doesn’t have an internship program, ask them if they would like a free intern for 6-8 weeks. Follow up job denial e-mails with a “thanks for considering me, perhaps you wouldn’t mind having me as an intern?” letter. Some internships will be reserved for students currently enrolled in a computer science/software engineering program but there is no harm in asking.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do not stop programming
Yes, boot camp is over. Yes, you are stressed out because of the job hunt. No, you can not stop coding. I don’t know about you, but after a few days away from the keyboard I start feeling a little foggy. Stay sharp and create more projects for the portfolio site.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do the standard stuff
Don’t forget about all the easy stuff that the Military taught you. Right place, right time, right uniform.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good Luck!&lt;/p&gt;

# Welcome!
Welcome to the Operation Code repo. This repo doesn't contain any code but does help coordinate all of our major projects. 
Curious to see what's going on? Check out our [roadmap](https://github.com/OperationCode/operationcode/projects/4) or our
[project descriptions](https://github.com/OperationCode/GETTING_STARTED).

## Goals
1. Serve Our Members
2. Foster the most positive and beginner friendly environement possible
3. Feature a project in as many languages as possible

## Operation Code
Operation Code is a nonprofit dedicated to getting veterans and their families into programming careers.
Our website (https://operationcode.org) is docker based and has frontend and a backend servers.

## What is a frontend?

When you visit our website you're intereacting with two systems, a frontend application and a backend application.
The frontend application (where you are now) is responsible for displaying images, text and data on our web pages.
Frontend applications are usually written using a combination of HTML, CSS, and Javascript and utilize 1 or more
frameworks such as Angular, backbone, vue, and react. https://operationcode.org uses react.

You can view the frontend repo at https://github.com/OperationCode/operationcode_frontend

## What is a backend?

The backend is responsible for providing data to the front end to display, and processing data entered into the
frontend, and running various jobs like inviting new users to slack, or signing them up for our newsletter. The
https://operationcode.org backend is written in rails and uses postgres, redis databases.

## Issues (Finding something to work on)

Each Operation Code repo should follow a few standards. Each issue will have at least 3 tags:  
`Priority` - describes how quickly an item should get done  
`Status` - Lets you know if an issue is being worked on, available to work on, or waiting for another issue to be completed before it can be worked on ('blocked')  
`Type` - What kind of issue is this? A bug denotes an issue that   

### Beginner friendly!
Each repo will also have a few curated issues designated as beginner friendly.
These issues should be very well documented and easily completable for someone with little to no coding experience.
